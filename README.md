# Stopwatch Application

This project is a simple **Stopwatch** application built using Python and the **CustomTkinter** library. It provides a clean and minimalistic user interface to track time with start, stop, and reset functionality.
This project is useful for anyone preparing for exams where speed is crucial. I built this stopwatch while practicing coding problems because no stopwatch available on the web had the feature to stay on top of the screen while I was typing. After this, I went on to build a complete clock application -- https://github.com/0maaz-01/Clock

## Features

- **Start:** Begin timing from the current state.
- **Stop:** Pause the timer while preserving the elapsed time.
- **Reset:** Reset the timer to `00:00:00`.
